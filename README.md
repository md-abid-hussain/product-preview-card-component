## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Loading different image for different screen was challenging. I learned to use **source set(srcset)** attribute of image tag as well as **source** tag and **picture** tag. Also i learned to use css variable.

### Continued development

I'll be focusing more in css as it is fundamental and required to learn some advance framework. I will be focusing on writing more organised css and using DRY principle.
